Features Needed: The training phase is completed. The dataset contains seven sixty eight
instances and nine features. The dataset features are:
● Total number of times pregnant
● Glucose/sugar level
● Diastolic Blood Pressure
● Body Mass Index (BMI)

● Skin fold thickness in mm
● Insulin value in 2 hour
● Hereditary factor- Pedigree function
● Age of patient in years
Percentage split option is provided for training and testing. Out of 768 instances 75 % is used
for training and 25% is used for testing
The model is trained for performing a variety of tasks using the training data set in machine
learning. To train the model, specific features are pulled from the training set. Therefore, the
prototype combines these structures. Single words or groups of words are selected from the
tweets for sentiment analysis. The model will be able to learn something from the features if
the training set is appropriately labeled. Therefore, such data is utilized to test the model and
determine if it is reacting correctly or not.
The input data is transformed via feature extraction to produce features. A distinguishing
factor across the various kinds of input designs is the presence of attribute square measures.
If the input data is too large for the algorithm to analyze, it will be assumed to be redundant
as the repetition of pixels-based images is converted into a condensed collection of attributes.
The selected job can be completed by using the extracted feature rather than the entire initial
data set.
