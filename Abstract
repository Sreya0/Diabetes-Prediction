One of the most fatal diseases in the world is diabetes. It is also the creator of a
number of different types of ailments, such as cardiac failure, blindness, urinary organ
problems, etc. In this situation, the patient must go to a diagnostic facility to receive their
reports following consultation. because they must commit both time and money each time.
However, with the development of machine learning techniques, we now have the freedom to
look for a solution to the current problem. We now have sophisticated systems that use
information processing that can predict whether a patient has polygenic illness or
not.Additionally, predicting the illness before it manifests is crucial for giving the patients
care. With information withdrawal, it is possible to eliminate hidden information from a
sizable collection of diabetes-related data. The objective of this investigation is to create a
system that could more accurately estimate a patient's level of diabetic risk.
